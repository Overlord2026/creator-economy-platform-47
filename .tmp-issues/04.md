Goal: CI fails fast on regressions & secrets.

Tasks:
- Add workflow with jobs: build, tsc, tests, gitleaks, Supabase types-drift.
- Add `.gitleaks.toml` (allow only VAR NAMES, not values).
- Ensure receipts tests run (see #7).

Acceptance:
- PRs fail if build/type/tests/secret/types drift break.
- Clear CI messages for each gate.
