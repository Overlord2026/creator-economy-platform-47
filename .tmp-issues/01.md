Goal: make env boring. App should refuse to boot without VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.

Tasks:
- Add `.env.local.example` with both vars.
- Add startup guard (clear error, graceful fail if missing).
- README: 3-step local setup.
- Ensure `.env.local` is in .gitignore.

Acceptance:
- Missing envs show one clear message; Vite doesnâ€™t crash loop.
- Reviewer can set `.env.local` and boot in < 60s.
