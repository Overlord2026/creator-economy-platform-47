Goal: prove canonicalize/hash are stable.

Tasks:
- `stableStringify` (NFC strings, key-sort, numbers -> 6 decimals).
- `sha256Hex`.
- `tests/canonical.spec.ts`: key order, NFC, decimal rounding, RFC3339 ts, hash=64 hex.
- Wire tests to CI.

Acceptance:
- All tests pass locally + CI.
- One-page doc on rules.
