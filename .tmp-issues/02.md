Goal: zero double-React and no docs HTML as entries.

Tasks:
- Pin react/react-dom 18.3.x; enforce Vite alias+dedupe.
- Vite: optimizeDeps.entries + build.rollupOptions.input -> index.html.
- Confirm no CDN React/preact in index.html.

Acceptance:
- `npm ls react react-dom` shows one 18.3.x pair.
- No dispatcher/null or import scanning cascades.
