# NIL Platform Demo Voiceover Script (45 seconds)

**[Professional, confident tone - 45 seconds total]**

"Here's the NIL workspace. I'll hit Reset NIL Demo—now invites, education status, and our first offer appear with no backend calls.

Every action generates a content-free receipt—no PII on chain. At the bottom, you can see new receipts appear, and some are anchored ✓ for tamper evidence.

For minors, guardians co-sign with one click—watch the co-sign receipts land instantly.

We simulate escrow—hold, release, and dispute. A Delta-receipt documents the dispute exactly.

Our Brand Match finds likely sponsors, and our Index tracks rising athletes. I can watch a profile; the receipt logs that, too.

Finally, I export a ZIP with the demo receipts so you can verify the trail offline. This is AI you can trust—receipts you can prove."
