# DETAILED SPECIFICATION
## LinkedIn & External Profile Data Auto-Population System

### TECHNICAL FIELD
This invention relates to computer-implemented methods for automated professional profile data integration, entity resolution, and cross-directory publishing with confidence-based approval workflows.

### BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Professional service providers maintain profiles across multiple platforms and directories, requiring manual data entry and updates. Existing systems lack sophisticated entity resolution, confidence scoring, and audit capabilities for professional credential verification.

### SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides a comprehensive system for automated professional profile data population with OAuth consent management, multi-source ingestion, probabilistic entity resolution, and confidence-based human approval workflows.

### DETAILED DESCRIPTION

#### System Architecture (FIG.1)
The system comprises external source connectors, OAuth consent gateway, ingestion pipeline, entity resolution engine, human review interface, data storage layer, and publishing adapters with monitoring capabilities.

#### Field-Level Mapping (FIG.2)  
Source data undergoes transformation using predefined rules with confidence scoring. Fields below threshold trigger human review queues with approval workflows.

#### Entity Resolution (FIG.3)
Probabilistic algorithms calculate similarity across multiple dimensions using weighted composite scoring with temporal decay. Blocking algorithms optimize performance by reducing candidate pairs.

#### Human Approval Interface (FIG.4)
Side-by-side profile comparison with confidence visualization enables reviewers to approve, reject, or request additional information for merge candidates.

### ADVANTAGES
1. Automated profile population reduces manual effort
2. Confidence scoring ensures data quality 
3. Entity resolution prevents duplicate records
4. Cross-directory publishing maintains consistency
5. Audit trails ensure compliance and traceability

### INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
The invention applies to professional services, financial planning, legal practice management, and regulated industries requiring credential verification and profile management.
