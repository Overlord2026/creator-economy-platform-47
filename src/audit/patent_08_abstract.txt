A computer-implemented system for automated professional profile data population employs OAuth-based consent management, multi-source data ingestion, and confidence-scored field mapping to create unified professional profiles. The system extracts profile data from external sources including LinkedIn and professional registries, applies probabilistic entity resolution using weighted similarity algorithms across multiple dimensions (name, email, license, firm affiliation), and implements confidence-based approval workflows with human-in-the-loop review for low-confidence mappings. Field-level transformation rules with confidence scoring enable automatic approval of high-confidence mappings while flagging uncertain data for manual review. The system features cross-directory publishing with differential synchronization, audit-safe rollback capabilities, and granular privacy consent management compliant with GDPR requirements. Registry verification integrates multiple professional databases (CFP, FINRA, State Bar) with conflict resolution using confidence-weighted voting. The approach significantly reduces manual data entry while maintaining data quality through sophisticated entity resolution and human oversight, enabling seamless professional profile management across multiple platforms and directories.
