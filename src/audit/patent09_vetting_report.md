## Algorithm Hotspots

### 1. Multi-Registry Identity Resolution Engine
```typescript
interface IdentityMatchingAlgorithm {
  // Probabilistic matching across registries
  fuzzyNameMatch(name1: string, name2: string): number;
  licenseNumberValidation(license: string, jurisdiction: string): boolean;
  biographicDataFusion(records: RegistryRecord[]): ConsolidatedProfile;
  confidenceScoring(matches: MatchResult[]): number;
}

// Pseudo-code for cross-registry matching
function resolveIdentityAcrossRegistries(professional: Professional): VerificationResult {
  const registryQueries = [
    queryFinraIAPD(professional),
    queryCFPBoard(professional),
    queryStateBar(professional.license_states),
    queryCPABoard(professional.license_states),
    queryNPIDatabase(professional)
  ];
  
  const results = await Promise.allSettled(registryQueries);
  const matchedRecords = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled');
  
  return fuseRegistryData(matchedRecords, professional);
}
```

### 2. Streak-Based Trust Scoring with Temporal Decay
```typescript
interface TrustScoringEngine {
  baseScore: number;
  verificationStreak: number;
  lastVerificationDate: Date;
  anomalyFlags: AnomalyFlag[];
  
  calculateTrustScore(): number {
    const streakBonus = Math.min(this.verificationStreak * 5, 25);
    const timeDecay = calculateTimeDecay(this.lastVerificationDate);
    const anomalyPenalty = this.anomalyFlags.reduce((sum, flag) => sum + flag.impact, 0);
    
    return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, 
      this.baseScore + streakBonus - timeDecay - anomalyPenalty
    ));
  }
}

// Time-weighted verification scoring
function calculateTimeDecay(lastVerification: Date): number {
  const daysSince = (Date.now() - lastVerification.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  return Math.floor(daysSince / 30) * 2; // 2 points per month
}
```

### 3. Cross-Jurisdiction Reconciliation Engine
```typescript
interface JurisdictionReconciler {
  reconcileLicenses(professional: Professional): LicenseStatus[];
  detectConflicts(licenses: LicenseStatus[]): Conflict[];
  prioritizeJurisdictions(conflicts: Conflict[]): Resolution[];
}

// License status reconciliation across states
function reconcileMultiStateLicenses(professional: Professional): ReconciliationResult {
  const stateQueries = professional.license_states.map(state => ({
    state,
    query: queryStateLicenseBoard(state, professional.license_number)
  }));
  
  const licenseStatuses = await Promise.all(stateQueries);
  const conflicts = detectStatusConflicts(licenseStatuses);
  
  return {
    primaryLicense: selectPrimaryLicense(licenseStatuses),
    conflicts: conflicts,
    recommendations: generateReconciliationPlan(conflicts)
  };
}
```

### 4. Continuous Monitoring & Re-verification Scheduler
```typescript
interface MonitoringEngine {
  scheduleReVerification(professional: Professional): void;
  detectAnomalies(professional: Professional): AnomalyReport;
  escalateToHuman(anomaly: AnomalyReport): EscalationTicket;
}

// Anomaly detection for verification monitoring
function detectVerificationAnomalies(professional: Professional): AnomalyReport {
  const anomalies = [];
  
  // License expiration monitoring
  if (isLicenseExpiringSoon(professional.licenses)) {
    anomalies.push({
      type: 'license_expiring',
      severity: 'medium',
      action: 'notify_professional'
    });
  }
  
  // Sanction list monitoring
  if (foundOnSanctionsList(professional)) {
    anomalies.push({
      type: 'sanction_hit',
      severity: 'critical',
      action: 'immediate_review'
    });
  }
  
  // Trust score degradation
  if (trustScoreDrop(professional) > 20) {
    anomalies.push({
      type: 'trust_degradation',
      severity: 'high',
      action: 'escalate_review'
    });
  }
  
  return { anomalies, requiresHumanReview: anomalies.some(a => a.severity === 'critical') };
}
```

## Security & RLS Considerations

### Row-Level Security Policies
- **Tenant Isolation**: All professional data is isolated by tenant_id with strict RLS policies
- **Role-Based Access**: Verification data access restricted based on user roles (admin, compliance_officer, etc.)
- **Audit Trail Protection**: Security audit logs are append-only with cryptographic integrity
- **Sensitive Data Encryption**: PII fields encrypted at rest with tenant-specific keys

### Data Protection Measures
- **Consent Management**: GDPR/CCPA compliant consent tracking for all verification activities
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary verification data retained based on regulatory requirements
- **Access Logging**: All verification data access logged with IP, user, and purpose tracking
- **Retention Policies**: Automated data purging based on compliance requirements and consent expiration

## Prior-Art Risk Notes

### Competitive Landscape Analysis
- **Traditional Background Check Services**: Sterling, HireRight, Checkr focus on criminal/employment history, not professional registry fusion
- **Professional Verification Services**: LexisNexis, Thomson Reuters provide static verification, lack continuous monitoring and trust scoring
- **RegTech Solutions**: IdentityMind, Jumio focus on identity verification, not professional credential validation
- **Compliance Platforms**: MetricStream, ServiceNow GRC lack specialized professional registry integration

### Key Differentiators
1. **Multi-Registry Fusion**: Novel approach to consolidating data across professional registries with confidence scoring
2. **Streak-Based Trust Scoring**: Temporal scoring with verification history weighting is unique in professional context
3. **Cross-Jurisdiction Reconciliation**: Automated reconciliation of multi-state professional licenses is underexplored
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time re-verification with anomaly detection is novel for professional credentials
5. **Automated Gating**: Role-based access control tied to verification status is innovative application

### Patent Landscape Assessment
- Few existing patents on professional credential verification automation
- No prior art found on streak-based trust scoring for professional networks
- Limited coverage of cross-jurisdiction license reconciliation in patent literature
- Blockchain anchoring of verification evidence appears novel in this domain
- Human-in-the-loop workflows for verification anomalies show patent potential

**Recommendation**: Proceed with provisional patent filing. Strong differentiated IP with minimal prior art overlap. Focus claims on multi-registry fusion, streak-based scoring, and continuous monitoring workflows.
