## Detailed Algorithm Examples

### Weighted Jaccard Similarity Calculation

**Input Data:**
```javascript
const fundHoldings = {
  "FUND_001": [
    {holding_id: "AAPL", weight_pct: 15.0, sector: "Technology"},
    {holding_id: "MSFT", weight_pct: 12.0, sector: "Technology"},
    {holding_id: "JNJ", weight_pct: 8.0, sector: "Healthcare"}
  ],
  "FUND_002": [
    {holding_id: "AAPL", weight_pct: 10.0, sector: "Technology"},
    {holding_id: "GOOGL", weight_pct: 14.0, sector: "Technology"},
    {holding_id: "JNJ", weight_pct: 6.0, sector: "Healthcare"}
  ]
};
```

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Intersection Calculation:**
   - AAPL: `min(15.0, 10.0) = 10.0`
   - JNJ: `min(8.0, 6.0) = 6.0`
   - Total Intersection: `16.0`

2. **Union Calculation:**
   - AAPL: `max(15.0, 10.0) = 15.0`
   - MSFT: `max(12.0, 0) = 12.0`
   - JNJ: `max(8.0, 6.0) = 8.0`
   - GOOGL: `max(0, 14.0) = 14.0`
   - Total Union: `49.0`

3. **Similarity Score:**
   - `16.0 / 49.0 = 0.327 (32.7% overlap)`

### LiquidityIQ™ Scoring Example

**Input Events:**
```javascript
const liquidityEvents = [
  {event_date: "2024-12-01", event_type: "gate", details: {}},
  {event_date: "2024-11-15", event_type: "partial-fill", details: {fill_rate: 0.7}}
];

const managerSignals = [
  {signal_type: "redemption_timeline", signal_value: 65, confidence_score: 0.8},
  {signal_type: "aum_trend", signal_value: 0.95, confidence_score: 0.9}
];
```

**Component Calculations:**
- **Gate Probability (35% weight):** Recent gate event → Score: 50/100
- **NAV-to-Cash (25% weight):** 65-day timeline → Score: 75/100  
- **Fulfillment Rate (20% weight):** 70% fill rate → Score: 70/100
- **Penalty Structure (10% weight):** No penalties → Score: 90/100
- **Vintage Adjustment (5% weight):** Recent vintage → Score: 70/100
- **AUM Trend (5% weight):** Declining AUM → Score: 60/100

**Final Score:**
```
Score = (50 × 0.35) + (75 × 0.25) + (70 × 0.20) + (90 × 0.10) + (70 × 0.05) + (60 × 0.05)
      = 17.5 + 18.75 + 14.0 + 9.0 + 3.5 + 3.0 
      = 65.75 → 66/100
```
