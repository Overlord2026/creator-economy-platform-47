interface FieldMapping {
  sourceField: string;
  targetField: string;
  transformation: TransformationRule;
  confidenceThreshold: number;
  humanReviewRequired: boolean;
}

function mapProfileFields(sourceData: any, mappingRules: FieldMapping[]): MappedProfile {
  // Apply transformation rules with confidence scoring
  // Flag fields below threshold for human review
  // Generate field-level audit trail
}
```

### 2. Taxonomy Normalizer
**Patent-Critical Algorithm**: Professional specialty and certification normalization across platforms.

```typescript
function normalizeProfessionalTaxonomy(rawSpecialties: string[]): NormalizedTaxonomy {
  // Apply fuzzy matching against standard taxonomy
  // Calculate semantic similarity scores
  // Resolve ambiguous classifications
}
```

### 3. Probabilistic Entity Resolution
**Patent-Critical Algorithm**: Multi-dimensional similarity scoring for duplicate detection.

```typescript
function calculateEntitySimilarity(profile1: Profile, profile2: Profile): EntitySimilarity {
  const nameScore = calculateNameSimilarity(profile1.name, profile2.name);
  const emailScore = calculateEmailSimilarity(profile1.email, profile2.email);
  const licenseScore = calculateLicenseSimilarity(profile1.licenses, profile2.licenses);
  const firmScore = calculateFirmSimilarity(profile1.firm, profile2.firm);
  
  // Weighted composite score with temporal decay
  return weightedComposite([nameScore, emailScore, licenseScore, firmScore]);
}
```

### 4. Confidence Scoring with Human-in-the-Loop
**Patent-Critical Algorithm**: Dynamic confidence thresholds with hysteresis and reviewer queue management.

```typescript
function assessMergeConfidence(similarity: EntitySimilarity, historicalData: MergeHistory): MergeDecision {
  // Apply confidence thresholds with hysteresis
  // Consider reviewer performance and bias
  // Queue for human review if below threshold
}
```

### 5. Registry Verification Fusion
**Patent-Critical Algorithm**: Multi-source verification with conflict resolution and confidence weighting.

```typescript
function fuseRegistryData(sources: VerificationSource[]): VerificationResult {
  // Weight sources by reliability and recency
  // Resolve conflicts using majority voting and confidence
  // Flag anomalies for manual review
}
```

### 6. Differential Sync with Conflict Resolution

```typescript
function syncProfileChanges(currentProfile: Profile, sourceUpdates: ProfileUpdate[]): SyncResult {
  // Detect field-level changes with timestamps
  // Apply conflict resolution rules
  // Generate rollback checkpoints
}
```

## Workflow

### Primary Workflow: Connect → Ingest → Map → Merge → Approve → Publish

1. **Connect Phase**
   - User initiates OAuth flow via LinkedInConnectButton
   - System exchanges authorization code for access token
   - Granular consent collected for specific profile fields

2. **Ingest Phase** 
   - Comprehensive profile data extracted from LinkedIn APIs
   - Professional registry verification triggered automatically
   - Raw data stored with source attribution and timestamps

3. **Map Phase**
   - Field-level mapping applied using transformation rules
   - Confidence scores calculated for each mapped field
   - Low-confidence fields flagged for human review

4. **Merge Phase**
   - Probabilistic entity resolution identifies duplicate candidates
   - Similarity scores calculated across multiple dimensions
   - Merge recommendations generated with confidence assessment

5. **Approve Phase**
   - Human reviewers evaluate flagged mappings and merges
   - Approval workflow with confidence thresholds and hysteresis
   - Rejected changes logged with reasoning

6. **Publish Phase**
   - Approved profile data published to target directories
   - Field-level transformations applied per directory requirements
   - Publishing status tracked with retry logic

### Differential Sync Loop

1. **Change Detection**
   - Scheduled sync jobs detect profile updates at source
   - Field-level change comparison with conflict identification
   - Delta generation with timestamp ordering

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Last-writer-wins with confidence weighting
   - Human review queue for high-confidence conflicts
   - Merge strategies for additive vs. subtractive changes

3. **Rollback & Recovery**
   - Checkpoint-based versioning for selective rollback
   - Field-level restoration capabilities
   - Audit trail preservation during rollback operations

- **Admin oversight**: System administrators have read-only audit access
- **Service isolation**: Background sync jobs use service role with minimal permissions

### Consent Management
- **Granular consent**: Field-level permissions with expiration dates
- **Consent revocation**: Immediate effect with data purging capabilities
- **Legal compliance**: GDPR Article 7 compliance with consent receipts
- **Purpose limitation**: Consent tied to specific processing purposes

### Audit and Compliance
- **Immutable audit trail**: All profile operations logged with tamper-evident signatures
- **Data lineage**: Complete source attribution for all profile fields
- **Retention policies**: Automated deletion based on consent expiration
- **Compliance reporting**: Privacy regulation adherence dashboards

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- **Field mapping functions**: Validate transformation rules and confidence scoring
- **Similarity algorithms**: Test entity resolution with known duplicate sets
- **Consent validation**: Verify field-level permission enforcement

### End-to-End Tests
- **Complete profile import**: Full workflow from OAuth to published profile
- **Merge approval**: Human reviewer workflow with confidence thresholds

## Prior-Art Risk Notes

### Competitive Landscape Analysis

**HubSpot CRM Data Import**: HubSpot provides LinkedIn integration for contact import but lacks the sophisticated entity resolution and multi-registry verification approach described in our system. Their focus is on sales lead management rather than professional credential verification.

**Salesforce Einstein Data**: Salesforce offers AI-powered data enrichment but primarily focuses on company data rather than individual professional credentials. They don't provide the granular consent management and field-level confidence scoring that characterizes our approach.

**ZoomInfo Contact Database**: ZoomInfo aggregates professional data but relies on web scraping rather than consented API access. Their system lacks the real-time verification against professional registries and the human-in-the-loop approval workflow.

**LinkedIn Sales Navigator**: While LinkedIn provides robust professional data access, they don't offer the cross-registry verification fusion or the sophisticated entity resolution algorithms described in our system. Their focus is on sales prospecting rather than compliance verification.

### Differentiation Factors

1. **Multi-Registry Verification Fusion**: Our approach uniquely combines data from CFP Board, FINRA, State Bars, and other professional registries with confidence-weighted conflict resolution.

2. **Consented Field-Level Mapping**: Unlike scraping-based systems, our approach requires explicit consent for each data field with granular expiration controls.

3. **Probabilistic Entity Resolution with Human Override**: Our system provides AI-driven duplicate detection with human reviewer queues for edge cases, balancing automation with accuracy.

4. **Cross-Directory Publishing with Rollback**: The ability to publish to multiple professional directories with differential sync and audit-safe rollback capabilities represents novel functionality.

5. **Confidence-Based Approval Workflows**: Dynamic confidence thresholds with hysteresis and reviewer performance tracking provides adaptive quality control.

### Patent Strategy Recommendations

1. **Focus on algorithmic innovations** in entity resolution and confidence scoring rather than basic OAuth integration
2. **Emphasize the novel combination** of multiple verification sources with conflict resolution
3. **Highlight the consent management approach** as differentiation from scraping-based competitors
4. **Document the human-in-the-loop workflow** as a key innovation for maintaining data quality
5. **Position cross-directory publishing** as a unique capability for professional service providers

The prior art risk is assessed as **medium** due to the crowded CRM and data enrichment space, but our focus on professional credential verification and consent-driven workflows provides meaningful differentiation for patent protection.
