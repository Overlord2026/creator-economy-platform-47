Sarah Mitchell: Good morning, David and Lisa. Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today to discuss your comprehensive financial planning strategy.

David Chen: Thank you, Sarah. We're really looking forward to this. We've been concerned about our retirement planning and want to make sure we're on the right track.

Lisa Rodriguez: Yes, especially with the market volatility we've been seeing lately. We want to understand our risk exposure better.

Sarah Mitchell: Absolutely. Those are excellent concerns to address. Let's start by reviewing your current investment portfolio and discussing your risk tolerance levels.

David Chen: Our 401(k) has been performing well, but we're not sure if we're diversified enough. We also need to discuss our children's education funding.

Sarah Mitchell: Great points. Education funding is crucial, and we'll want to explore 529 plans. I also noticed some gaps in your insurance coverage that we should address.

Lisa Rodriguez: Insurance gaps? That sounds concerning. What kind of gaps are you seeing?

Sarah Mitchell: Primarily in your disability insurance coverage. Given your income levels, we need to ensure you're adequately protected. This is a significant risk we should mitigate.

David Chen: Okay, that makes sense. What are our next steps? Should we schedule a follow-up meeting to dive deeper into these issues?

Sarah Mitchell: Yes, I recommend we schedule a follow-up in two weeks. I'll prepare a detailed analysis of your portfolio and insurance needs. You should also gather your recent tax returns and investment statements.

Lisa Rodriguez: We'll get those documents together. Should we also start researching the 529 plans you mentioned?

Sarah Mitchell: That would be helpful. I'll send you some initial research on the best 529 options for your state. We'll review everything together at our next meeting.
