**"Here's the Advisor Console. New leads arrive with contact consent already captured.**

**Click Start Meeting—attach a transcript or paste notes. We generate a clean summary, a proof slip, and a vault pack.**

**Launch a ready-made drip—each send becomes a compliant Comms proof slip.**

**The pipeline tracks progress; Admin can audit every slip with one click.**

**It's your full stack: lead gen, meetings, emails, calculators—with receipts you can prove."**
