**"This is your Family Home. Two clicks start a meeting or upload notes.**

**We produce a clear summary—and a tiny proof slip that shows what was discussed and why.**

**Files go to your Secure Vault with a time-stamped seal.**

**Want to see numbers? Try Retirement Roadmap or a Roth ladder. Every action records a proof slip you can see here.**

**You decide which professionals—advisor, CPA, attorney—can see what. Everything's in one place, always traceable."**
