# API Integration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the API integration points within the Family Office Marketplace application. It serves as a guide for developers and system administrators who need to connect the application to external services or implement backend functionality.

## API Integration Architecture

The application is designed with clear separation between the UI layer and the data services. All API calls go through a dedicated service layer that handles data fetching, transformation, and error handling.

### Key Integration Points

1. **Authentication Services**
   - OAuth 2.0 integration for secure login
   - JWT token management
   - Session handling and refresh

2. **Family Office Directory API**
   - Fetching family office listings
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Detailed profile information

3. **Marketplace Listings API**
   - Product and service catalog
   - Pricing information
   - Availability and scheduling

4. **Document Management API**
   - Secure document upload/download
   - Version control
   - Access permissions

5. **Calendar Integration API**
   - Appointment scheduling
   - Availability management
   - Meeting confirmations and reminders

6. **Financial Data API**
   - Account aggregation
   - Transaction history
   - Portfolio performance

## Integration Implementation

Each service follows a consistent pattern:

```typescript
// Example API service
export class MarketplaceAPIService {
  private baseUrl: string;
  private authToken: string;

  constructor(config: APIConfig) {
    this.baseUrl = config.baseUrl;
    this.authToken = config.authToken;
  }

  async getListings(filters?: ListingFilters): Promise<MarketplaceListing[]> {
    // Implementation details
  }

  async getListingDetails(id: string): Promise<MarketplaceListingDetail> {
    // Implementation details
  }

  // Other methods...
}
```

### Error Handling

All API services implement consistent error handling:

```typescript
try {
  const data = await apiService.getData();
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof APIError) {
    // Handle specific API errors
    switch (error.code) {
      case 'AUTHENTICATION_FAILED':
        // Handle auth failure
        break;
      case 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED':
        // Handle rate limiting
        break;
      default:
        // Handle other known errors
    }
  } else {
    // Handle unexpected errors
    logger.error('Unexpected error in API call', error);
  }
  throw error; // Re-throw for component handling
}
```

## Authentication

API authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens. The flow is:

1. User authenticates with credentials
2. System receives JWT token and refresh token
3. JWT token is stored in memory (never in localStorage)
4. Refresh token is stored in secure HTTP-only cookie
5. API calls include the JWT token in the Authorization header
6. Token refresh is handled automatically when expired

```typescript
// Example authorization header
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${jwtToken}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

## Environment Configuration

API endpoints are configured based on the environment:

- Development: Uses mock data with occasional calls to staging APIs
- Testing: Points to dedicated test environment
- Production: Uses production APIs with strict rate limiting and security

## Mock Data Mode

During development, the application can run in mock data mode, which simulates API responses without making actual network requests. This is controlled by the `USE_MOCK_DATA` environment variable.

When mock mode is enabled:
- API services return predefined data from `mockData` directory
- Network requests are logged but not sent
- Latency can be simulated with a configurable delay

## Rate Limiting and Optimization

To ensure optimal performance and respect API limits:

1. Responses are cached where appropriate using React Query
2. Debouncing is applied to search inputs
3. Pagination is implemented for large data sets
4. Requests are batched where possible

## Security Considerations

All API integrations follow these security principles:

1. All communications use HTTPS
2. PII is encrypted in transit and at rest
3. API keys are never exposed to client-side code
4. Sensitive operations require re-authentication
5. All API access is logged for audit purposes

## Webhooks and Real-time Updates

For real-time features, the application uses webhooks and/or WebSockets:

- Appointment status changes
- Document updates
- Message notifications
- System alerts

## Testing API Integrations

Each API integration includes dedicated tests:

1. Unit tests for service methods
2. Integration tests with mock servers
3. End-to-end tests with actual API endpoints
4. Performance tests for high-volume operations

## Implementation Checklist

When implementing a new API integration:

- [ ] Define data models and interfaces
- [ ] Create service class with standard methods
- [ ] Implement error handling with specific error types
- [ ] Add caching strategy using React Query
- [ ] Create mock data for development and testing
- [ ] Document service methods and parameters
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
- [ ] Review for security considerations

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Failures

- Verify token expiration
- Check for correct scopes
- Ensure refresh token is valid

### Rate Limiting

- Implement exponential backoff
- Use caching to reduce request frequency
- Batch requests where possible

### Data Inconsistencies

- Validate response data against expected schema
- Check for API version differences
- Verify transformation logic

## Conclusion

Following these integration patterns ensures consistent, secure, and performant API usage throughout the application. All integrations should adhere to these guidelines to maintain system reliability and security.
