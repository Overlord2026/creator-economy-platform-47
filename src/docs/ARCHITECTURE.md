# Application Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This application follows a modular, layered architecture designed for progressive enhancement. The architecture allows for independent development of the frontend while providing clear integration points for future backend services.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility and clear boundaries
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: The application can function with mock data before API integration
3. **Consistent Interfaces**: APIs and hooks maintain consistent signatures across development phases
4. **Modular Design**: Components are independent and reusable
5. **Clear Integration Points**: Well-defined points for future backend integration

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Frontend Development with Mock Data (Current)

- Full UI implementation with responsive design
- Mock data providers and service placeholders
- Complete user flows and interactions
- Console logging of future API integration points

### Phase 2: Initial API Integration

- Replace mock data with real API calls
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Add error handling and loading states
- Maintain UI consistency through hooks

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features

- Implement advanced search and filtering
- Add real-time updates and notifications
- Integrate analytics and monitoring
- Performance optimizations and caching

## Module Boundaries

### UI Layer

**Description**: Presentation components responsible for rendering and user interaction

**Key Files**:
- `src/components/*`: Reusable UI components
- `src/pages/*`: Top-level page components

**Responsibilities**:
- Render data from hooks
- Handle user interactions
- Manage local UI state
- Trigger data operations via hooks

**Integration Points**:
- Consumes data exclusively through hooks
- Never directly accesses API services

### Data Layer

**Description**: Hooks and contexts that manage application state and data fetching

**Key Files**:
- `src/hooks/*`: Custom React hooks
- `src/context/*`: React context providers
- `src/modules/*/hooks/*`: Module-specific hooks

**Responsibilities**:
- Fetch and cache data
- Manage loading and error states
- Provide data to UI components
- Handle data operations (CRUD)

**Integration Points**:
- Uses API services for data operations
- Provides consistent interfaces to UI components regardless of data source

### Service Layer

**Description**: Services that handle external communication and business logic

**Key Files**:
- `src/modules/*/api/*`: API services
- `src/services/*`: Utility services

**Responsibilities**:
- Communicate with external APIs
- Transform data between frontend and backend formats
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Implement business logic

**Integration Points**:
- Current: Returns mock data with console logs
- Future: Makes real API calls with the same signatures

## Key Modules

### Marketplace Module

**Purpose**: Provides marketplace functionality for services and family offices

**Components**:
- Listings display
- Category filtering
- Search functionality
- Listing details

**Data Flow**:
1. UI components use `useMarketplace` hook
2. Hook calls methods in `marketplaceApiService`
3. Service returns data (mock now, real API later)
4. Hook manages state and provides data to components

**Future Enhancements**:
- Advanced filtering and search
- Real-time updates for new listings
- Personalized recommendations

### Document Management Module

**Purpose**: Manages document storage, categorization, and access

**Components**:
- Document upload
- Document list/grid
- Category management
- Search and filter

**Data Flow**:
1. UI components use `useDocumentManagement` hook
2. Hook calls methods in `documentService`
3. Service handles document operations
4. Hook updates state and notifies components

**Future Enhancements**:
- Secure document storage
- Version control
- Sharing and permissions
- Document preview

### Bills Management Module

**Purpose**: Tracks, categorizes, and optimizes user bills

**Components**:
- Bill list/grid
- Bill details
- Optimization insights
- Payment tracking

**Data Flow**:
1. UI components use `useBills` provider
2. Provider combines `useBillsManagement` and `useInsightsManagement`
3. Hooks handle bill operations and insights
4. Components render bills and insights data

**Future Enhancements**:
- Bill payment integration
- Automated categorization
- Budget forecasting
- Vendor optimization

## Integration Guidelines for Development Teams

### For Frontend Developers

1. Use the provided hooks for data access, never directly call API services
2. Maintain separation between UI and data logic
3. Handle loading and error states consistently
4. Follow the established component patterns

### For Backend Developers

1. Implement API endpoints that match the signatures in the service layer
2. Follow the response structures expected by the hooks
3. Implement authentication that integrates with the existing flow
4. Use the console logs as guides for required endpoints

### For Full-Stack Integration

1. Start by replacing individual service methods with real API calls
2. Test each integration point thoroughly before moving to the next
3. Maintain backward compatibility during transition periods
4. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Test components in isolation using mock hooks
- Test hooks with mock services
- Test services with mock API responses

### Integration Testing

- Test components with real hooks
- Test hooks with mock services
- Test the full data flow from UI to service

### E2E Testing

- Test complete user flows
- Simulate API responses in Phase 1
- Use real APIs in later phases

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for progressive development. By maintaining clear module boundaries and consistent interfaces, the application can evolve from a frontend prototype to a full-featured product with minimal refactoring.

Each module is designed to be self-contained with clear inputs and outputs, making it easy for development teams to work independently on different parts of the application while ensuring seamless integration.
