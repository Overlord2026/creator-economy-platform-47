Partnership opportunity: Coverage checks for your {{client_type}} clients

### Preheader
Privacy-first insurance analysis that builds trust and adds value

### Body
Hi {{contact_name}},

I hope this finds you well. I'm reaching out because I think there's a valuable partnership opportunity between {{partner_name}} and {{firm_name}}.

**The Challenge**
Your clients often ask about insurance during the {{transaction_type}} process, but most agents can't provide quick, trustworthy guidance without requiring extensive personal information upfront.

**Our Solution: Scan & Save**
We've developed a privacy-first coverage analysis tool that:
- Provides banded insights in minutes, not hours
- Keeps client PII in their secure vault
- Generates content-free **Proof-of-Receipts** for compliance
- Builds trust through transparency

**The Partnership**
- Co-branded emails to your client database
- "Coverage Check" widgets for your closing communications
- Shared revenue on any policies bound through referrals
- Full compliance documentation for your records

**Next Steps**
I'd love to show you a 10-minute demo of how this works and discuss the revenue sharing structure.

Are you available for a brief call this week?

Best regards,

Quick follow-up on my partnership proposal last week.

I wanted to share this 2-minute demo of **Scan & Save** so you can see how it would work for {{partner_name}} clients:

**{{demo_link}}**

**What partners tell us:**
- "Clients love that their data stays private during the analysis"
- "It adds value to our closing process without complexity"
- "The revenue share is meaningful without affecting our core business"

**Current Results:**
- 40% of families who complete Scan & Save book consultations
- Average revenue per referral: $1,200-$2,800 annually
- Partner commission: 15-25% depending on volume

**Still interested in a brief conversation?**

I'm happy to work around your schedule.
