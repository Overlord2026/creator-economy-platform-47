## Email 2 - Day 2 (Educational)

### Subject
3 coverage gaps most families miss (and how to spot them)

### Preheader
Banded insights that help you protect what matters most

### Body
{{first_name}},

Most families have coverage gaps they don't know about. Here are the three we see most often:

**1. Umbrella Liability Mismatch**
Many policies have underlying limits that don't align with umbrella requirements. This creates a gap where you think you're covered but aren't.

**2. Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value**
Your auto policy might pay ACV when you expected replacement cost — especially important for newer vehicles.

**3. Flood vs. Water Damage**
Standard homeowners excludes flood but covers some water damage. The difference matters more than most realize.

**Scan & Save identifies these patterns** in your existing coverage using privacy-preserving analysis. Your data stays secure while you get professional-grade insights.
