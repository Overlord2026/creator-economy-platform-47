## 📋 **Decisions Log Block**

**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Decision**: Adopted 3-tier classification system: (A) read_all for lookups, (B) owner/admin policies for user data, (C) service-role + redaction views for sensitive PII/financial data. Implemented database hardening: revoked public CREATE, secured search_path, moved extensions to dedicated schema, tightened default privileges.

**Impact**: PII/financial data (estate, VIP, firm contacts) now protected with masked public views while preserving business functionality. Zero UX disruption. Compliant-by-default access patterns for HIPAA/SOX requirements.
