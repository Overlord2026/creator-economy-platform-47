# Families UI Fixes Implementation Summary

## Files Changed

### Core Fixes
- **src/components/families/FamilyHero.tsx**: Added Get Started routing with prelaunch detection and analytics tracking
- **src/pages/ValueCalculator.tsx**: Implemented controlled horizon state (horizonYears: 10|20|30) with aria-pressed and analytics
- **src/components/pricing/PlanSuggestionChip.tsx**: Added localStorage persistence for upgrade pill dismissal
- **src/utils/getStartedUtils.ts**: Created utility for consistent Get Started routing with prelaunch mode
- **src/index.css**: Already contains `--header-stack: 112px` variable
- **src/pages/SolutionsPage.tsx**: Added proper header stack spacing

### Analytics Events Implemented
- `onboarding.viewed` - When Get Started is clicked
- `calc.horizon_set` - When time horizon buttons are clicked
- `upgrade.intent` - When upgrade modal is opened
- `upgrade.dismissed` - When upgrade pill is dismissed

### Tests Added
- **src/__tests__/ValueCalculator.test.tsx**: Unit tests for horizon toggle functionality
- **src/__tests__/FamiliesPage.test.tsx**: Accessibility and header spacing tests

## Header Stack Implementation

All main pages now use:
```css
main {
  padding-top: var(--header-stack); /* 112px */
  scroll-margin-top: var(--header-stack);
}
```

Applied to:
- ✅ /families (FamiliesPage.tsx)
- ✅ /pros (ProsPage.tsx) 
- ✅ /solutions (SolutionsPage.tsx)
- ✅ /education (EducationPage.tsx)
- ✅ /tools/value-calculator (ValueCalculator.tsx)

## Value Calculator Horizon Controls

- ✅ Single controlled state: `horizonYears: 10|20|30`
- ✅ Proper aria-pressed attributes for accessibility
- ✅ Analytics tracking on selection changes
- ✅ Visual states with proper contrast

## Get Started Routing

- ✅ Default route: `/onboarding?persona=family&segment=retirees`
- ✅ Prelaunch mode: routes to `/waitlist`
- ✅ Analytics tracking for onboarding flow

## Upgrade Pill Persistence

- ✅ localStorage key: `bfo.upgrade.dismissed`
- ✅ Respects prelaunchMode (hidden when true)
- ✅ Dismissal persists across page reloads

## Verification Steps

1. **Header overlap**: Navigate between /families, /pros, /solutions, /education - content should be visible below sticky headers
2. **Calculator controls**: On /tools/value-calculator, click 10/20/30 year buttons - should show active state and emit analytics
3. **Get Started flow**: Click "Get Started" on families page - should route to onboarding or waitlist based on prelaunch mode
4. **Upgrade pill**: Dismiss upgrade suggestion - should stay dismissed on page reload
5. **Accessibility**: Tab navigation should work properly with focus indicators
