## Background History Samples

### What Are Background History Samples?

Background history samples are anonymized (or permissioned) example profiles, scenarios, or audit logs that show how the MyBFOCFO platform tracks, manages, and secures data changes over time.

These samples are used for:
- **Demonstrating audit/compliance capabilities**
- **Training new team members or advisors**
- **Giving customers and prospects confidence in data transparency**
- **Testing workflows and operational scripts in a sandbox environment**

### Sample Background History Entries
