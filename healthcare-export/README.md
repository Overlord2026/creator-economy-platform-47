## 📊 Database Schema

### Health Metrics
- Track any health measurement (blood pressure, weight, glucose, etc.)
- Temporal data with automatic timestamps
- User-scoped with RLS policies

### Healthcare Documents
- Secure file storage with metadata
- Category-based organization
- Sharing capabilities with providers
- Privacy controls

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only access their own data
- **Encrypted Storage**: All files encrypted at rest
- **Access Controls**: Granular permissions for data sharing
- **Audit Logging**: Track all data access and modifications
- **HIPAA Ready**: Designed with healthcare compliance in mind

## 🎨 UI Components

All components use shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for consistent styling:

- **HealthCard**: Display key health metrics with status indicators
- **HealthMetricCard**: Detailed metric display with trends
- **DocumentUploadModal**: Secure file upload with metadata
- **FileUploadDropzone**: Drag-and-drop file interface

## 🪝 React Hooks

### useHealthData
```typescript
const {
  metrics,        // Health metrics array
  isLoading,      // Loading state  
  createMetric,   // Create new metric
  updateMetric,   // Update existing metric
  deleteMetric    // Delete metric
} = useHealthData();
```

### useHealthDocs
```typescript
const {
  documents,      // Documents array
  stats,          // Document statistics
  isLoading,      // Loading state
