Next Step: Developer, QA, and Ops Onboarding Playbook (“Runbook”)
Why:

Ensures that as soon as you—or anyone on your team—imports data, launches a new feature, or onboards a new dev, there is no confusion or risk.

Lets you scale with zero drama, zero guesswork, and zero “tribal knowledge” issues.

A. Create a “Developer & Operations Runbook” in README.md or Notion
Copy-paste and customize this:

## Developer & Operations Runbook

### 1. Initial Project Setup

- Clone this repo and review the README for core scripts.
- Request access to Supabase and GitHub (admins: add new team members as needed).

### 2. Resetting and Seeding Test Data

- When data is available, use `/supabase/seeders/reset_test_data.sql` to quickly clear or reset demo/test users and content.
- For custom datasets, document the import process here.

### 3. Security & RLS Policies

- All core tables have Row Level Security enabled and enforced.
- Review policies before any schema or business logic changes.

### 4. Audit Logging

- All UPDATEs (and optionally INSERTs/DELETES) on sensitive tables are logged to `public.audit_logs`.
- Audit log queries are included above.

### 5. Backups

- Automated daily backups are enabled in Supabase.
- Before any migration or bulk import, take a manual backup via the dashboard.

### 6. Restoring From Backup

- Contact a Supabase admin or DBA for full restores.
- Partial/table restores: use export/import with the SQL Editor or pg_dump/pg_restore if comfortable.

### 7. Data Import Checklist (for when you add real data)

- [ ] Back up the blank/test database first!
- [ ] Confirm schema matches your source data.
- [ ] Run imports in a staging environment before production.
- [ ] Review audit logs and RLS after import to ensure security is preserved.
- [ ] Document any changes to scripts, triggers, or policies in the repo.

### 8. Onboarding New Developers or Operators

- Add them to GitHub and Supabase (minimum permissions).
- Point them to this README/runbook as step one.
- Require PRs for any change to core SQL/scripts.
- Schedule a demo walk-through of reset, audit, and backup flows.

### 9. Compliance, Security, and QA

- Run quarterly “tabletop” disaster recovery drills (restore a backup, check audit logs).
- Periodically review RLS and audit policies for drift.
- Update docs with every major schema, policy, or security change.

**This runbook is your “one source of truth” for all data operations,  
and will keep onboarding, scaling, and support a frictionless experience.**

B. Next-Ready Steps (for When Data Arrives)
As soon as you have real data or imports,

Use your audit log, backup, and test data scripts as designed.

Document any “gotchas” so every new hire, consultant, or partner follows the same gold-standard flow.

C. (Optional) Schedule a Team Review
Once a month (or quarter), review the runbook and all critical scripts as a team.

Update as needed after any new feature or migration.

Summary Table: Your Current Platform Status
Area	Status	Next Action
Security	✅ Hardened RLS	Review per release
Audit Logs	✅ Active	Monitor, extend as needed
Test Data	✅ Scripted reset	Add import flow when data arrives
Backups	✅ Scheduled	Download before data import
Docs/Onboarding	✅ README/runbook	Review quarterly

Your next move:

Paste/update the runbook above in your README or Notion.

When ready, use it as the master checklist for every dev, data import, or ops scenario.

You’re fully prepared—when you get user data or start onboarding, you’ll be bulletproof from day one.
