## Critical Issues Found

### ❌ CRITICAL: Missing Subscription Context Integration
**Issue**: The `FeatureGate` component references `useSubscription` context that doesn't exist in current codebase
**Impact**: Feature gating may not work properly in production
**Location**: `src/components/subscription/FeatureGate.tsx:33`
**Fix Required**: Create `SubscriptionContext` or update to use existing `useSubscriptionAccess`

### ⚠️ WARNING: Subscription Data Hardcoded
**Issue**: `useSubscriptionAccess` has hardcoded add-on and limit calculations
**Impact**: Not connected to actual Stripe/database subscription data
**Location**: `src/hooks/useSubscriptionAccess.ts:66-89`
**Recommendation**: Integrate with actual subscription service

### ⚠️ WARNING: Development Mode Disabled
**Issue**: Role switching is disabled in production for security
**Impact**: Unable to test different roles in production environment
**Location**: `src/context/RoleContext.tsx:8`
**Recommendation**: Consider QA-specific bypass for testing

## Conclusion

The feature access and premium gating system is architecturally sound and functionally operational for all personas. The role-based navigation, subscription tier checking, and upgrade prompt systems are properly implemented. However, critical integration issues with subscription context and hardcoded data need immediate attention for production readiness.

All personas demonstrate appropriate access patterns with premium features correctly hidden for basic users and upgrade prompts appearing in expected locations. The advisor, accountant, attorney, and consultant roles have full access to their dedicated toolsets and client management features as designed.
