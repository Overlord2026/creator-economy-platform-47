## üö¶ Core Operations

- **Test Data Reset:**  
  SQL scripts for resetting demo and test data are in `/supabase/seeders/` and `/scripts/`.
- **Audit Logging:**  
  Every update to sensitive tables is tracked in `public.audit_logs`.  
  View recent logs with:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM public.audit_logs ORDER BY changed_at DESC LIMIT 10;
    ```
- **RLS Policies:**  
  Row Level Security is enabled and versioned in `/supabase/policies/`.
- **Backups:**  
  Daily backups are enabled in Supabase. See the runbook for restore procedures.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance

- Strict RLS on all sensitive/user-facing tables.
- Tamper-evident audit logs and audit trigger code in `/supabase/functions/`.
- All policies, audits, and operational scripts are versioned and peer-reviewed.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Developers/Operators

1. **Clone the repo and review the README.**
2. **Review the Runbook and Security docs.**
3. **Use `/supabase/seeders/reset_test_data.sql` to reset the testbed.**
4. **Check audit logs after any update or migration.**
5. **For questions, see docs or contact the ops/security lead.**
