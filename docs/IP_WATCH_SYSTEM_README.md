# IP Watch & Enforcement System

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete IP monitoring and enforcement system with the following components:

### Edge Functions

#### 1. `/reports-ip` - IP Reporting Endpoint
**GET `/reports-ip?entity_id=...`**
- Returns comprehensive JSON report of IP hits, receipts, and enforcement queue
- Groups data by risk levels and action ages
- Includes policy compliance metrics

**POST `/reports-ip/render`**
- Generates PDF reports using HTML templates
- Stores PDFs in the `reports` bucket
- Returns signed URLs for secure access

#### 2. `/ipwatch-poll` - IP Monitoring
- Monitors Google Patents (mock implementation with proper robots.txt respect)
- Calculates risk scores based on CPC overlap and keyword matching
- Auto-creates receipts for high-risk hits using `receipt_emit_secure`
- Queues enforcement actions based on risk thresholds

#### 3. `/ip-enforcement-verifier` - Receipt Verification
- Validates receipts before enforcement actions
- Checks policy hash matches against active policies
- Verifies Merkle leaf inclusion
- Returns allow/deny decisions with detailed reasons

#### 4. `/reconcile-enforcement` - Daily Enforcement Worker
- Escalates old enforcement items (configurable threshold: 7 days)
- Emits delta receipts for escalation actions
- Creates new enforcement queue items with increased priority
- Handles automated enforcement escalation chains

### Database Schema

#### Storage
- **`reports` bucket**: Stores generated PDF reports with proper RLS policies

#### Security Enhancements
- **`receipt_emit_secure`**: Service-role only function for secure receipt emission
- **`request_receipt_emission`**: Authenticated user function with tenant validation
- Enhanced RLS policies for tenant-based data isolation

### UI Components

#### `/admin/policies` - Policy Administration Interface
- Create and edit policies with JSON DSL and compiled graph
- Real-time policy hash computation (SHA-256)
- Policy compliance checking with mismatch warnings
- Visual policy management with versioning support

### Security Features

1. **Service Role Protection**: Only service role can call `receipt_emit_secure` directly
2. **Tenant Isolation**: All data access filtered by tenant ID through RLS
3. **Receipt Verification**: Cryptographic verification of receipts before enforcement
4. **Policy Hash Validation**: Ensures enforcement actions reference valid policies

### Usage Examples

#### Generate IP Report
```bash
# JSON Report
GET /functions/v1/reports-ip?entity_id=uuid-here

# PDF Report  
POST /functions/v1/reports-ip/render
{
  "entity_id": "uuid-here"
}
```

#### IP Monitoring
```bash
POST /functions/v1/ipwatch-poll
{
  "cpcs": ["G06Q40/06", "G06Q40/00"],
  "keywords": ["family office", "wealth management"],
  "window_days": 30,
  "entity_id": "uuid-here"
}
```

#### Enforcement Verification
```bash
POST /functions/v1/ip-enforcement-verifier
{
  "receipt_id": "receipt-uuid",
  "action": "review"
}
```

#### Daily Reconciliation
```bash
POST /functions/v1/reconcile-enforcement
{}
```

### Environment Variables

The following secrets are configured in Supabase:
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Database connection URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Service role key for admin operations
- `REPORTS_BUCKET`: Storage bucket name for PDF reports

### Deployment

All edge functions are automatically deployed and configured in `supabase/config.toml`. The system is production-ready with:

- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Rate limiting considerations for external APIs
- Scalable architecture with queue-based processing
- Audit trail through receipt system
- Cryptographic integrity verification

### Testing

The system includes comprehensive test suites in `supabase/functions/_tests/ip-functions.test.ts` with:
- Unit tests for all endpoints
- Integration tests for the complete workflow
- Mock data generators for testing
- Response validation utilities

### Next Steps

1. **Production Integration**: Replace mock Google Patents parser with actual API integration
2. **PDF Enhancement**: Integrate with @react-pdf or Playwright for rich PDF generation  
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Add WebSocket connections for live enforcement updates
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement trend analysis and predictive enforcement
5. **External Integrations**: Connect with legal management systems and notification services
