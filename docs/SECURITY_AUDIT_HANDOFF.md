# Security Audit & Backend Handoff

## Summary

- All custom public schema Postgres functions are now secured with `SECURITY INVOKER` and `SET search_path = ''`.
- Functions in system-managed schemas (`vault`, `pgbouncer`, `graphql`) **cannot** be modified by project owners; these are documented and have been escalated to Supabase support.
- Supabase support ticket ref: **xcmqjkvyvuhoslbzmlgi**
- This doc serves as the single source of truth for compliance, onboarding, and any future remediation.

Support Escalation
Supabase support ticket ref: xcmqjkvyvuhoslbzmlgi

Summary: All system-managed SECURITY DEFINER functions in the vault, pgbouncer, and graphql schemas are not user-editable. These have been documented and submitted to Supabase for official confirmation.

Next Steps (for future backend developers or compliance)
All new Postgres functions in public or app-owned schemas must use SECURITY INVOKER and SET search_path = '' per audit.

System/extension schemas must be reviewed during future audits; escalate to platform support if non-editable.

Store a copy of this file in /docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_HANDOFF.md in the repository and reference in onboarding docs.

If permissions change (e.g., after a platform update), apply the secured SQL code above to the now-editable functions.

Keep this file up to date with any new compliance or support ticket activity.
