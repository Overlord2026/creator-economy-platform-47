## Example Policy â†’ Canonical DAG

### Input Policy
```
POLICY admin_user_access {
  WHEN role = "admin" AND tenant = "family_office_1"
  THEN ALLOW ["read:users", "write:users", "delete:users"]
}

POLICY advisor_client_access {
  WHEN role = "advisor" AND tenant = "family_office_1" AND time BETWEEN "09:00" "17:00"
  THEN ALLOW ["read:clients", "write:client_notes"]
}
```

### Canonical DAG Representation

    },
    {

## Canonicalization Rules

1. **Node Sorting**: Nodes are sorted alphabetically by ID
2. **Edge Sorting**: Edges are sorted by `from` field, then `to` field  
3. **Scope Sorting**: Scope arrays within effects are sorted alphabetically
4. **Condition Normalization**: Conditions of same type are grouped and sorted
5. **Data Consistency**: All data objects have keys sorted alphabetically

## Structural Hash Calculation

The structural hash is calculated from the canonical representation:

```typescript
function calculateStructuralHash(graph: PolicyGraph): string {
  const canonical = {
    nodes: graph.nodes.map(n => ({
      id: n.id,
      type: n.type, 
      data: JSON.stringify(n.data, Object.keys(n.data).sort())
    })),
    edges: graph.edges.map(e => ({
      from: e.from,
      to: e.to,
      weight: e.weight
    }))
  };
  
  const canonicalStr = JSON.stringify(canonical, Object.keys(canonical).sort());
  return sha256(canonicalStr);
}
```

## Cache Key Generation

Enhanced cache keys include structural hash for content-based caching:

```typescript
interface CacheKey {
  tenant: string;
  version: string; 
  jurisdiction: string;
  structural_hash: string;
}

// Example: "family_office_1:v2.1:US:a1b2c3d4e5f6789"
```

This ensures that policies with identical structure share cache entries regardless of cosmetic differences in policy IDs or ordering.
