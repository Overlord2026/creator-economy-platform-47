## Abstract

An automated professional vetting engine that performs multi-registry identity resolution, continuous credential monitoring, and streak-based trust scoring for professional service providers. The system integrates with multiple professional registries (CFP Board, FINRA, state bar associations, CPA boards, NPI database) to create consolidated verification profiles with confidence scoring. A novel streak-based trust scoring algorithm incorporates verification history, temporal decay factors, and anomaly detection to generate dynamic trust scores. The system provides continuous monitoring with scheduled re-verification, cross-jurisdiction license reconciliation, and automated role gating based on verification status. Human-in-the-loop workflows handle anomalies and edge cases, while tamper-evident audit trails provide compliance documentation. The invention enables automated compliance verification for regulated professional networks while maintaining high accuracy and reducing manual verification overhead.

## Background of the Invention

### Field of the Invention

This invention relates generally to automated professional credential verification systems, and more specifically to systems and methods for performing multi-registry identity resolution, continuous monitoring, and trust scoring for professional service providers across multiple jurisdictions and regulatory frameworks.

### Description of Related Art

Traditional professional verification systems suffer from several limitations that make them unsuitable for modern regulated professional networks:

**Static Verification Approaches:** Existing background check services like Sterling, HireRight, and Checkr focus primarily on criminal history and employment verification, providing point-in-time snapshots without ongoing monitoring of professional credentials or regulatory status changes.

**Single-Registry Limitations:** Current professional verification services typically query individual registries in isolation (e.g., FINRA BrokerCheck, state bar lookups, CPA board searches) without consolidating results or resolving identity conflicts across multiple sources.

**Manual Reconciliation:** When professionals hold licenses in multiple jurisdictions, existing systems require manual review to reconcile conflicting information, detect expired credentials, or identify disciplinary actions across different regulatory bodies.

**Lack of Trust Evolution:** Conventional systems assign binary verification status (verified/unverified) without considering verification history, consistency over time, or building trust through repeated successful verifications.

**No Continuous Monitoring:** Most verification services operate as one-time checks without ongoing monitoring for license expirations, disciplinary actions, sanctions list additions, or other status changes that could affect professional standing.

**Limited Automation:** Current systems require significant manual intervention for anomaly resolution, cross-jurisdiction conflicts, and verification decision-making, leading to scalability issues and inconsistent results.

These limitations create significant challenges for organizations managing large networks of professionals, particularly in regulated industries where ongoing compliance verification is critical for operational and regulatory requirements.

## Summary of the Invention

The present invention provides an automated professional vetting engine that addresses the limitations of existing verification systems through several key innovations:

**Multi-Registry Fusion:** The system integrates with multiple professional registries and databases (CFP Board, FINRA IAPD/BrokerCheck, state bar associations, CPA boards, NPI database, OFAC sanctions lists) to perform comprehensive identity resolution using probabilistic matching algorithms. The system consolidates data from disparate sources, resolves conflicts, and assigns confidence scores to verification results.

**Streak-Based Trust Scoring:** A novel trust scoring algorithm incorporates verification history, temporal factors, and consistency metrics to generate dynamic trust scores that evolve over time. The system rewards consistent verification success through streak bonuses while applying time decay and anomaly penalties to maintain accuracy.

**Cross-Jurisdiction Reconciliation:** Automated algorithms reconcile professional licenses across multiple states and jurisdictions, detecting conflicts, prioritizing primary licenses, and generating reconciliation recommendations for professionals operating in multiple regulatory environments.

**Continuous Monitoring:** The system implements scheduled re-verification jobs, real-time monitoring of registry updates, and anomaly detection to identify changes in professional status, license expirations, disciplinary actions, or sanctions list additions.

**Automated Role Gating:** Verification status is automatically integrated with role-based access control systems, enabling or restricting professional access to client data, system features, and business functions based on current verification standing.

**Human-in-the-Loop Escalation:** Sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms identify edge cases, conflicts, or unusual patterns that require human review, with structured workflows for escalation and resolution.

**Tamper-Evident Audit Trails:** All verification activities are logged in cryptographically secured audit trails with optional blockchain anchoring for immutable evidence preservation and regulatory compliance.

The invention enables organizations to automate professional compliance verification while maintaining high accuracy, reducing manual overhead, and providing continuous assurance of professional credential validity across complex multi-jurisdiction regulatory environments.

## Detailed Description

### System Architecture and Core Components

The automated professional vetting engine comprises several interconnected subsystems that work together to provide comprehensive verification services:

#### Multi-Registry Integration Layer

The system integrates with multiple professional registries through standardized API connections and web scraping interfaces:

- **CFP Board API Integration:** Connects to the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards database to verify CFP certifications, disciplinary history, and continuing education compliance.

- **FINRA Integration:** Interfaces with FINRA's Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IAPD) and BrokerCheck systems to verify investment advisor registrations and broker-dealer associations.

- **State Bar Integrations:** Implements jurisdiction-specific connectors for state bar associations, handling varying API formats and authentication requirements across different states.

- **CPA Board Integration:** Connects to state-level CPA licensing boards to verify accounting credentials, continuing education compliance, and disciplinary status.

- **NPI Database Integration:** Queries the National Provider Identifier database for healthcare professionals to verify medical credentials and practice information.

- **Sanctions List Monitoring:** Integrates with OFAC, state disciplinary databases, and other sanctions lists for ongoing compliance monitoring.

#### Identity Resolution Engine

The identity resolution engine performs probabilistic matching across multiple registries to create consolidated professional profiles:

```sql
-- Core identity matching algorithm
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_professional_identity(
  p_name VARCHAR,
  p_license_number VARCHAR,
  p_jurisdiction VARCHAR,
  p_email VARCHAR DEFAULT NULL
) RETURNS TABLE (
  registry_type VARCHAR,
  match_confidence DECIMAL(5,2),
  verified_data JSONB
) AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Implement fuzzy name matching with phonetic algorithms
  -- Cross-reference license numbers across jurisdictions  
  -- Validate biographical data consistency
  -- Return ranked match results with confidence scores
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

The matching algorithm considers multiple factors:
- Exact and fuzzy name matching using Soundex and Levenshtein distance
- License number format validation and cross-referencing
- Biographical data consistency (birth dates, addresses, education)
- Professional timeline validation (employment history, credential dates)

#### Streak-Based Trust Scoring Algorithm

The trust scoring system implements a sophisticated algorithm that considers verification history, temporal factors, and anomaly indicators:

```sql
-- Trust score calculation with streak bonuses and decay
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_trust_score(
  p_professional_id UUID
) RETURNS DECIMAL(5,2) AS $$
DECLARE
  base_score DECIMAL(5,2) := 70.0;
  streak_bonus DECIMAL(5,2) := 0.0;
  time_decay DECIMAL(5,2) := 0.0;
  anomaly_penalty DECIMAL(5,2) := 0.0;
  final_score DECIMAL(5,2);
BEGIN
  -- Calculate verification streak bonus
  SELECT calculate_streak_bonus(p_professional_id) INTO streak_bonus;
  
  -- Apply time decay based on last verification
  SELECT calculate_time_decay(p_professional_id) INTO time_decay;
  
  -- Calculate anomaly penalties
  SELECT calculate_anomaly_penalty(p_professional_id) INTO anomaly_penalty;
  
  -- Compute final score with bounds checking
  final_score := base_score + streak_bonus - time_decay - anomaly_penalty;
  
  RETURN GREATEST(0, LEAST(100, final_score));
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

The streak calculation rewards consistent verification success:
- Consecutive successful verifications earn progressive bonuses
- Different verification types have weighted contributions
- Streak breaks due to failures or expired credentials reset bonuses
- Maximum streak bonus caps prevent unlimited score inflation

#### Cross-Jurisdiction Reconciliation

For professionals licensed in multiple states, the system implements automated reconciliation:

```sql
-- Cross-jurisdiction license reconciliation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION reconcile_multi_state_licenses(
  p_professional_id UUID
) RETURNS TABLE (
  primary_license JSONB,
  conflicts JSONB[],
  recommendations JSONB[]
) AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Query all jurisdictions for license status
  -- Detect conflicts in status, expiration dates, or disciplinary actions
  -- Apply jurisdiction precedence rules
  -- Generate reconciliation recommendations
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Reconciliation considers:
- License status conflicts (active in one state, suspended in another)
- Expiration date inconsistencies across jurisdictions
- Disciplinary action reporting differences
- Continuing education requirement variations

#### Continuous Monitoring System

The monitoring system implements scheduled jobs and real-time alerts:

```sql
-- Scheduled re-verification job management
CREATE TABLE re_verification_jobs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  professional_id UUID NOT NULL,
  registry_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  scheduled_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  priority VARCHAR DEFAULT 'normal',
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

-- Anomaly detection triggers
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION detect_verification_anomalies()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Monitor for trust score drops
  -- Detect licensing status changes
  -- Flag sanctions list additions
  -- Trigger human review workflows
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Algorithm Implementation Details

#### Multi-Registry Identity Matching

The identity matching algorithm uses multiple techniques to achieve high accuracy:

1. **Exact Matching:** Direct comparison of license numbers, emails, and exact name matches
2. **Fuzzy Matching:** Levenshtein distance and Soundex algorithms for name variations
3. **Biographical Validation:** Cross-reference birth dates, addresses, and education history
4. **Timeline Consistency:** Validate career progression and credential acquisition dates
5. **Confidence Scoring:** Weighted combination of match factors with threshold-based decisions

#### Streak-Based Trust Scoring

The trust scoring algorithm implements several sophisticated components:

**Base Score Calculation:**
- Initial score based on credential level and verification completeness
- Professional type weighting (attorney: 75, advisor: 70, CPA: 80)
- Registry quality scoring (FINRA: high, state databases: medium)

**Streak Bonus System:**
- Consecutive successful verifications earn progressive bonuses
- Verification type weighting (license renewal: 5 points, CE completion: 3 points)
- Maximum streak bonus capped at 25 points to prevent inflation
- Streak reset conditions (failed verification, expired credential, disciplinary action)

**Time Decay Function:**
- Linear decay of 2 points per month since last verification
- Accelerated decay after 6 months without verification
- Different decay rates by professional type and risk level

**Anomaly Penalty Calculation:**
- Sanctions list hits: -20 points (immediate review)
- License expiration: -15 points (grace period considerations)
- Disciplinary actions: -10 to -25 points (severity-based)
- Data inconsistencies: -5 to -10 points (requires investigation)

#### Cross-Jurisdiction Reconciliation Rules

The reconciliation engine implements jurisdiction-specific business rules:

**Primary License Selection:**
1. Home state license (if clearly established)
2. Highest activity state (based on client concentration)
3. Most restrictive jurisdiction (for compliance purposes)
4. Most recently issued license (for tie-breaking)

**Conflict Resolution Priority:**
1. Active license takes precedence over suspended
2. More recent information overwrites older data
3. Disciplinary actions from any jurisdiction apply globally
4. Continuing education requirements use most restrictive standard

#### Continuous Monitoring Algorithms

**Re-verification Scheduling:**
- Risk-based scheduling (high-risk professionals verified monthly)
- Registry-specific schedules (bar associations annually, FINRA quarterly)
- Adaptive scheduling based on historical verification stability
- Priority escalation for expiring credentials or detected anomalies

**Anomaly Detection Patterns:**
- Sudden trust score drops exceeding threshold percentages
- License status changes across any monitored jurisdiction
- New entries on sanctions lists or disciplinary databases
- Inconsistent data updates across multiple registries
- Unusual verification patterns or API response anomalies

### Security and Compliance Features

#### Data Protection and Privacy

**Encryption at Rest:**
- Professional PII encrypted using tenant-specific keys
- Database-level encryption for sensitive credential data
- Encrypted backups with separate key management

**Access Control:**
- Role-based access control integrated with verification status
- Principle of least privilege for verification data access
- Mandatory multi-factor authentication for admin functions

**Audit Trail Integrity:**
- Cryptographic hash chaining for tamper detection
- Optional blockchain anchoring for immutable audit records
- Real-time monitoring for unauthorized access attempts

#### Regulatory Compliance

**Data Retention:**
- Automated purging based on regulatory requirements
- Consent-based retention for GDPR compliance
- Litigation hold capabilities for legal proceedings
