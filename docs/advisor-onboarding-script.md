## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Platform Questions

**Q: How does white-labeling work?**
A: Your platform displays your firm's branding throughout. Clients see your logo, colors, and custom messaging. They never see our company name unless you choose to include it as "powered by" attribution.

**Q: What's the difference between Premium and Elite advisor tiers?**
A: Premium includes core practice management, basic planning tools, and standard client communication. Elite adds advanced marketing automation, SMS/phone integration, bulk operations, and enhanced compliance features.

**Q: Can I trial the platform before committing?**
A: Yes, we offer a 30-day trial with full access to Premium features. Elite features require a consultation to ensure proper setup.

### Client Invitation & Onboarding

**Q: How do I invite my existing clients?**
A: Use your unique advisor link to send personalized invitations. Clients complete their profile at their own pace, and you can monitor progress through your dashboard.

**Q: Can clients link their family members?**
A: Yes, the primary account holder can invite family members and assign roles (spouse, dependent, etc.). You control how many seats each household can access.

**Q: What if a client needs help during onboarding?**
A: Clients have access to our support team, plus you can see their progress and reach out proactively. Premium clients get priority support.

**Q: Do clients need to provide sensitive information immediately?**
A: No, clients can explore most features with basic information (name/email). Sensitive data like SSN is only required when they choose to become full clients or use premium features.

### Technical & Compliance

**Q: How do you handle data security?**
A: We use bank-level encryption, SOC 2 compliance, and maintain audit trails for all data access. Client data is never shared without explicit permission.

**Q: What integrations are available?**
A: We integrate with major custodians (Schwab, Fidelity, etc.), CRM systems, portfolio management tools, and communication platforms. Elite advisors get priority integration support.

**Q: Can I export client data if I leave the platform?**
A: Yes, you can export all client data in standard formats. We provide migration assistance to ensure smooth transitions.

### Billing & Pricing

**Q: How are seats billed?**
A: You're billed monthly for active client seats. Inactive clients (no login for 90 days) are automatically moved to a reduced rate. You can pause or cancel seats at any time.

**Q: Can I pass costs through to clients?**
A: Yes, many advisors include platform costs in their advisory fees or bill separately. We provide white-labeled invoicing to support either approach.

**Q: What happens if a client wants to upgrade their features?**
A: Clients can upgrade directly through their portal, or you can facilitate the upgrade. Revenue sharing options are available for advisors who help drive upgrades.

### Support & Training

**Q: What ongoing support do I receive?**
A: Premium advisors get email support and access to our knowledge base. Elite advisors get dedicated account management, priority phone support, and quarterly business reviews.

**Q: Do you provide client training materials?**
A: Yes, we maintain a library of video tutorials, user guides, and FAQ content that you can share with clients. All materials can be co-branded with your firm.

**Q: How do you handle feature requests?**
A: We maintain a product roadmap based on advisor feedback. Elite advisors get priority consideration for feature requests and can participate in beta testing programs.

### Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

**Q: Client forgot their password and can't log in**
A: Clients can reset passwords themselves, or you can trigger a reset from your admin panel. We also support SSO integration for firms using identity management systems.

**Q: Client concerned about data privacy**
A: Share our privacy policy and security documentation. Highlight that they control what data they share and can delete their account at any time.

**Q: Client wants to connect accounts but doesn't trust Plaid**
A: Plaid is used by major banks and has strong security. For concerned clients, manual entry is always available as an alternative.

**Q: Client household has complex family structure**
A: Our platform supports various relationship types and custom roles. Contact support for assistance with complex family setups.

**Q: Integration isn't working with client's custodian**
A: Check our integration status page for known issues. Most problems resolve within 24 hours. Manual data entry is available as backup.

## Script for Staff Training

### Handling Advisor Questions

"When an advisor asks about features, always mention both the current capability and the roadmap. For example: 'Our tax scanning currently handles 1040s and basic schedules, with partnership and trust returns coming next quarter.'

Focus on business outcomes, not just features. Instead of 'We have portfolio reporting,' say 'Your clients can see their performance across all accounts in one place, which reduces calls and improves satisfaction.'

When discussing pricing, position it as investment in practice growth: 'The platform typically pays for itself within 60 days through improved efficiency and client retention.'"

### Common Objections and Responses

**"It's too expensive"**
"Consider the cost of hiring additional staff to provide the same level of service. Most advisors save 10-15 hours per week, which more than covers the platform cost."

**"My clients won't use technology"**
"Our platform is designed for all generations. We have clients from 25 to 95 using it successfully. The interface is intuitive, and we provide unlimited training support."

**"We already have these tools"**
"The power is in having everything integrated. Instead of logging into 5 different systems, everything is in one place. That's where the real efficiency gains come from."

### Escalation Guidelines

- Technical issues: Route to support team
- Pricing negotiations: Route to sales management
- Feature requests: Document and route to product team
- Compliance questions: Route to compliance specialist
- Integration problems: Route to technical team with specific details

This comprehensive training package ensures advisors understand the full platform value and can confidently onboard their clients.
