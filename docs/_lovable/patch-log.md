## feat/advisor-intake - Advisor Platform Integration

### 2025-09-15 - Finalize Advisor Platform Wiring
- **Aliases**: Added `@advisor/*` alias mapping to `src/features/advisors/platform/*`

  - Index: Dashboard (existing component)
  - Prospects, Recordings, Questionnaires, Templates, ROI, Calendar: TODO pages
