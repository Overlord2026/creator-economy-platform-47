Subject: Cut Compliance Prep from Weeks to Days

Hi [Attorney Name],

Yesterday I shared how our platform can replace multiple legal software tools. Today, let me show you something that will really get your attention: AUTOMATED COMPLIANCE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS.

THE COMPLIANCE NIGHTMARE:
Most attorneys spend 40+ hours preparing for compliance audits, manually gathering documents, emails, and call logs scattered across different systems. One missing piece can result in violations and hefty fines.
