Subject: Grow Client Value with Integrated Planning Tools

Dear [Attorney Name],

This week I've shown you how our platform streamlines operations and automates compliance. Now let me share the story that convinced dozens of firms to make the switch: HOW ONE ESTATE PLANNING PRACTICE ADDED $750,000 IN ANNUAL REVENUE.

REAL CLIENT SUCCESS STORY:
Firm: Mid-sized estate planning practice (15 attorneys)
Location: Denver, Colorado  
Challenge: Clients needed both legal and financial planning, but firm was losing revenue to separate financial advisors

RESULTS AFTER 12 MONTHS:
• 35% increase in client throughput
• $750K new revenue from integrated financial planning
• 2 weeks → 2 days compliance audit preparation  
• 92% client satisfaction with new integrated approach

HOW THEY DID IT:
1. IDENTIFIED HIGH-VALUE CLIENTS
   Used our platform to flag estate clients with $1M+ assets who needed retirement planning

2. DEPLOYED SWAG™ ROADMAP  
   Integrated retirement and tax planning into estate planning engagements

3. STREAMLINED OPERATIONS
   Automated workflows freed up 15+ hours per week for higher-value client work

CLIENT TESTIMONIAL:
"We went from competing with financial advisors to partnering with our legal expertise. Clients love getting comprehensive planning in one place, and our revenue per client increased by an average of $15,000. The compliance automation alone saves us 40 hours per month."
— Sarah Mitchell, Managing Partner
