# MVP Readiness Checklist - Families

## Navigation (Sidebar Items Present & Working)
- [x] **Dashboard**: `/families/home` and `/family/home` - Working (src/pages/families/FamilyHome.tsx)
- [x] **Family Type Pages**: `/families/:type` - Working (src/pages/families/FamilyTypeDashboard.tsx)
- [x] **Tools Hub**: `/family/tools` - Working (src/pages/family/FamilyToolsHub.tsx)
- [x] **Assets**: `/family/assets` - Working (src/pages/family/AssetsPage.tsx)
- [x] **Roadmap**: `/family/roadmap` - Working (src/pages/family/FamilyRoadmap.tsx)

**Navigation Structure**: Multiple patterns - no unified sidebar for families

## Tools Open & Render (Reports, Cash Flow, Transactions, Accounts, Goals)
- [ ] **Reports**: `/reports` - Available but generic (src/pages/ReportsPage.tsx)
- [x] **Cash Flow**: `/cashflow` - Feature complete (src/features/cashflow/pages/CashFlowPage.tsx)
- [x] **Transactions**: `/transactions` - Feature complete (src/features/transactions/pages/TransactionsPage.tsx)
- [ ] **Accounts**: `/accounts` - Stub only ("Accounts - Coming Soon")
- [x] **Goals**: `/goals` - Feature complete, family-focused (src/pages/GoalsPage.tsx)

## Persona Context Handled
- [x] **Partial** - PersonaGuard present but inconsistent
  - File: `src/App.tsx` lines 447, 451 (families routes)
  - Logic: Some routes protected, others open
  - Context: Family segment switching via PersonaSwitcher components
  - Issue: Multiple persona switcher implementations

## Data Surface Wired (Mock/Live)
- **Live Data**: Supabase integration
  - Goals: `user_goals` table with family categories
  - Family profiles: Available via auth context
  - Assets: Connected to real data structure
- **Mock Data**: 
  - Cash flow and transactions use API hooks
  - Family dashboard metrics mostly demo data

## Empty/Error States Present
- [x] **Goals**: Yes - Excellent family-focused empty state (src/pages/GoalsPage.tsx:135-155)
- [x] **Transactions**: Yes - Generic empty state
- [x] **Cash Flow**: Yes - Generic empty state
- [ ] **Reports**: No empty states
- [ ] **Accounts**: No empty states (stub)
- [ ] **Family Dashboard**: Needs empty states for new families

## Copy Polish Needed
- **Goals**: Excellent family copy - "Experience Return", "dream bigger"
- **Dashboard**: Generic financial metrics need family context
- **Tools**: Some tools have advisor-focused copy (needs family perspective)
- **Navigation**: Inconsistent labeling across different family sections
- **Missing**: Family-specific value propositions and onboarding messaging

## Blockers

### P0 Blockers (Must Fix for MVP)
1. **Accounts Tool Missing** - Core family financial management missing
   - File: `src/App.tsx:401, 483`
   - Impact: Cannot manage family accounts

2. **Navigation Fragmentation** - No unified family sidebar/navigation
   - Files: Multiple navigation patterns across family pages
   - Impact: Confusing user experience

### P1 Blockers (Should Fix for MVP)
1. **Persona Context Gaps** - Inconsistent family segment protection
   - File: `src/App.tsx:446-453` (some family routes unprotected)
   - Impact: Broken persona experience

2. **Dashboard Data Integration** - Mostly demo data
   - Files: Family dashboard components showing mock metrics
   - Impact: Not reflecting real family data

3. **Tool Context Mismatch** - Some tools show advisor-focused copy
   - Files: Various tool components need family perspective
   - Impact: Poor family user experience

### P2 Blockers (Nice to Have)
1. **Family Onboarding Flow** - Missing guided setup for new families
2. **Family-specific Reports** - Reports tool needs family customization
3. **Multi-generational Support** - No clear handling of family member roles
4. **Mobile Experience** - Family tools need mobile optimization

## Family-Specific Considerations
- **Segment Variations**: Different needs for Aspiring vs Retirees vs HNW families
- **Multi-user Access**: Spouse/partner access patterns not clearly defined
- **Goal Categories**: Family goals well-implemented but need better categorization
- **Privacy Controls**: Family data sharing and access controls unclear
