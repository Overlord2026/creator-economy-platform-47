**Purpose:** fast, objective review to converge on an investor-ready, paid-ready plan.

## 0. Executive Read (2 min)
- One-line problem, one-line wedge, one-line differentiation (Evidence & Receipts™, RuleSync™).

## 1. Problem Clarity (score 0–2)
- Who hurts now? (creators, college/HS athletes, brands, collectives, universities)
- How do they solve it today? (marketplaces, agencies, spreadsheets, DMs)
- Quantified pain (time, risk, $)

## 2. ICPs & JTBD (0–2)
- ICP1: Brand/agency running micro-campaigns with creators/athletes
- ICP2: Athlete/creator (HS, college, U23) needing safe deals, split-pay, disclosures
- ICP3: University/collective ops + compliance
- Jobs: discover → negotiate → disclose → deliver → pay/split → prove

## 3. Solution & Differentiation (0–2)
- Built-in compliance (FTC disclosure, school/NCAA policy capture), content-free receipts for actions, RuleSync™ policy enforcement, escrow/split-pay, audit trail.

## 4. IP & Moat (0–2)
- Patents map to: (a) provable actions, (b) policy-bound payouts, (c) cross-platform proofs.
- Data/benchmarks moat (deal flow, compliance history).

## 5. Market & Timing (0–2)
- NIL + creator-economy growth; rule volatility = need for provable compliance.

## 6. GTM & Pricing (0–2)
- Wedge: "Proof-first monetization" for creators & athletes.
- Channels: collectives, ADs, agencies, brand partnerships, campus ambassadors.
- Pricing tests: per-deal fee + team/university/agency SaaS tiers.

## 7. Business Model & Unit Economics (0–2)
- Fee take rate, SaaS tiers, payment float/escrow economics, partner rev-share.

## 8. Compliance & Risk (0–2)
- School/NCAA policy capture; FTC Endorsement Guides; IRS information returns; HS/NCAA/State patchwork. (This file does NOT provide legal advice.)

## 9. Roadmap & Evidence (0–2)
- 90-day, 180-day milestones; demo loops; pilots; content-free receipts logged.

**Pass Gates:** (a) wedge validated with 3 paying logos or 100 paid deals, (b) audited receipts pipeline, (c) zero PII exposure in proofs.
