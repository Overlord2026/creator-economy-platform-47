## Today's reality (with sources inline in competitor_matrix.csv)
- Schools can directly compensate athletes via revenue-sharing starting 2025–26, in addition to NIL; NIL continues. 
- HS NIL is permitted in many states; patchwork drives demand for standardized disclosures.
- FTC endorsement disclosure rules apply to social promotions; brands and creators need automated compliance.
- 1099‑K thresholds are in flux; follow IRS guidance.

### Regulatory Context (analyst notes, not legal advice)
- **NCAA & revenue sharing:** House v. NCAA settlement approved June 6, 2025; schools may pay athletes beginning 2025–26 season, with an initial cap around ~$20.5M per school; NIL remains additive. Sources: ESPN; Honest Game explainer.
- **High school NIL:** Majority of states now permit some HS NIL; patchwork is evolving. Sources: Business of College Sports HS NIL tracker (Aug 27, 2025); SI state-by-state overview (Jun 5, 2025).
- **FTC Endorsement Guides:** Material connection disclosures are required for influencer content; brands must instruct and monitor disclosures. Source: FTC business guidance.
- **Tax reporting (platforms/payments):** IRS guidance shows Form 1099‑K phased thresholds ($2,500 for 2025; $600 for 2026+) per IRS Notice/Instructions. Source: IRS 1099‑K page & 2025 instructions.
- **Video game group licensing:** OneTeam/EA programs operate at large scale; compensation increased for "College Football 26" per reports. Sources: Reuters; AP/industry coverage.

## White Space for Our Wedge
- **Proof-first workflow**: embed evidence/receipts into every deal step (offer → disclosure → deliverable → split-pay).
- **Cross-platform content proofs**: link posts without storing content; anchor hashes + timestamps.
- **Policy-bound payments**: funds release tied to disclosure + deliverable verification (RuleSync™).
- **One ledger for brands + schools + agents**: unify audit without sharing sensitive content.

## How We Win
- Sell "risk-off growth": more deals with less admin/risk.
- Integrate with marketplaces (supply) and creator tools (distribution) while owning compliance & payments layer.
