# NIL Platform â€” Investor One-Pager

## Problem
The NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) ecosystem is fragmented and high-risk:
- **Compliance chaos**: FTC disclosure violations, school policy breaches, tax reporting gaps
- **Payment complexity**: Split payments across athletes/agents/schools with no audit trail
- **Platform silos**: Content created on TikTok/Instagram, deals negotiated elsewhere, payments scattered
- **Risk exposure**: Brands face regulatory fines, schools risk NCAA violations, athletes lose eligibility

## Target ICPs (Priority Order)
1. **Agencies/Brands** running micro-campaigns â†’ Need safe split-pay + automated disclosures
2. **Collectives/Universities** â†’ Need disclosure automation + compliant payouts + audit trails  
3. **Creators/Athletes** â†’ Need mobile-first app for offers, deliverables, receipts, tax center

## Wedge: Proof-First Monetizationâ„¢
**"We don't just process NIL deals â€” we prove them happened correctly"**
- Embed cryptographic evidence into every deal step (offer â†’ content â†’ disclosure â†’ payment)
- Cross-platform content verification with tamper-evident receipts
- Policy-bound payments that auto-enforce FTC/school rules before funds release

## Solution: Evidence & Receipts + RuleSyncâ„¢
**Core Innovation**: Content-free audit ledger + automated compliance engine
- **Evidence Layer**: SHA256 proofs for every action (offer sent, content posted, disclosure made, payment cleared)
- **RuleSync Engine**: Auto-sync FTC guidelines + school policies â†’ block non-compliant payments
- **Unified Ledger**: Single source of truth for brands, schools, agents across all platforms
- **Mobile-First**: Athletes get receipts, tax docs, compliance training in one app

## Why Now
- **House v. NCAA Settlement** (June 2025): $20.5M school revenue sharing + NIL remains additive
- **High School NIL Expansion**: Majority of states now permit HS NIL (patchwork regulation)
- **FTC Enforcement**: Material connection disclosure requirements intensifying
- **Tax Reporting**: IRS 1099-K thresholds dropping to $600 (2026) â†’ compliance burden rising
- **Creator Economy**: $104B market with fragmented tooling â†’ consolidation opportunity

## Market
- **NIL Market**: ~$1.7B annually (college + high school expansion)
- **Creator Economy**: $104B+ with 50M+ creators globally
- **Compliance SaaS**: $50B+ market growing 15% annually
- **TAM**: $5B+ addressable (NIL + creator compliance + payments)

## Competition
*Reference: See `competitor_matrix.csv` for full analysis*

**Key Gaps We Fill:**
- **Teamworks/INFLCR**: AD-centric, limited brand/creator tooling
- **OpenSponsorship**: Marketplace-only, no native school compliance
- **Opendorse**: Social tools, weak payment/audit layer
- **CollectiveAssist**: Collective-focused, no cross-platform proofs

**White Space**: Proof-first workflow + cross-platform evidence + policy-bound payments

## GTM Strategy
**Phase 1 (0-90 days)**: Agencies/Brands
- 2 agency partnerships for micro-campaign compliance
- Per-deal fees + white-label compliance dashboard

**Phase 2 (90-180 days)**: Collectives/Universities  
- 3 campus pilots for disclosure automation
- SaaS tiers for AD departments

**Phase 3 (180+ days)**: Direct-to-Creator
- Mobile app launch for athletes/creators
- Freemium â†’ premium conversion model

## Business Model
**Revenue Streams:**
- **Per-Deal Fees**: 1.9%-3.9% of deal value (market rate)
- **SaaS Tiers**: 
  - Agency/Brand: $299-$1,499/month
  - Collective/AD: $499-$2,500/month  
  - Creator Pro: $0-$19/month (freemium)
- **Compliance Services**: Audit exports, training modules, custom policy integration

**Unit Economics**: 70%+ gross margins, $150+ LTV/CAC target

## 90/180 Day Roadmap
**Next 90 Days:**
- âœ… Core platform MVP (Evidence & Receipts system)
- ðŸŽ¯ 2 agency partnerships signed
- ðŸŽ¯ 100 deals with proof-of-compliance
- ðŸŽ¯ FTC/school policy engine v1

**Following 90 Days:**
- ðŸŽ¯ 3 campus collective pilots
- ðŸŽ¯ Mobile app beta launch
- ðŸŽ¯ Cross-platform content verification
- ðŸŽ¯ $50K+ MRR from SaaS tiers

## Traction Goals (90 Days)
- **100 cleared deals** with cryptographic proof trails
- **NRR >110%** from early agency customers  
- **3 paying logos** across agency/collective segments
- **50+ athletes** onboarded with compliance training completed

## Risks & Mitigations
**Regulatory Changes**: 
- *Risk*: NCAA/FTC rule changes
- *Mitigation*: RuleSync engine auto-adapts to policy updates

**Competition**: 
- *Risk*: Teamworks/big players build similar features
- *Mitigation*: Patent pending on proof-first workflow; network effects

**Adoption**: 
- *Risk*: Behavior change required
- *Mitigation*: Start with high-pain segments (agencies facing FTC fines)

## Team
**Platform Capabilities:**
- Full-stack development with React/TypeScript/Supabase
- Cryptographic proof systems with tamper-evident audit trails
- Real-time compliance engine with policy automation
- Mobile-first creator tools with seamless UX

**Domain Expertise Needed:**

## The Ask
**Seeking**: $2M Seed Round

**Use of Funds:**
- 40% Engineering (mobile app, enterprise features)
- 35% Go-to-market (sales, partnerships, pilot programs)  
- 15% Compliance/Legal (regulatory expertise, policy engine)
- 10% Operations (team expansion, infrastructure)

**Milestones**: Break-even by Month 18, Series A readiness with $1M+ ARR
