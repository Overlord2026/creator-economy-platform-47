# Opendorse Profile

Opendorse operates as a comprehensive NIL marketplace and contract management platform targeting brands, collectives, and universities. They offer a large marketplace with strong college partnerships and specialized "Contracts" tooling for collectives, positioning themselves as the infrastructure layer for university NIL operations. Their heavy focus on school/collective workflows creates an opportunity for us to capture the broader creator economy crossover that they've left relatively unaddressed.
