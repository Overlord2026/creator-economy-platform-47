# Athliance Profile

Athliance operates as a compliance platform for universities and agents through their PointGuard system for schools and reps, offering workflow management and alerts with NIL deal disclosure automation. They provide specialized tools for reps and collectives but are not positioned as a brand-side marketplace, creating opportunity for platforms that can serve the full ecosystem from brand discovery through compliance documentation.
