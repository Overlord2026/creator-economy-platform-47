# Basepath Profile

Basepath focuses on NIL operations and wallet functionality for collectives and universities, providing automated tasks, contracts, payments, tax estimation, and disclosures. They've found adoption among DII/DIII schools but have limited marketplace demand generation capabilities, presenting an opportunity for platforms that can combine operational efficiency with robust marketplace and brand discovery features.
