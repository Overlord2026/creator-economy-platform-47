# Postgame Profile

Postgame positions itself as an agency-at-scale platform for brands, specializing in group social NIL campaigns across thousands of athletes with large-scale campaign capabilities and tracking tools. They operate with a full-service agency motion, but compliance proofing is not their core value proposition, creating opportunity for platforms that embed compliance and audit capabilities directly into the campaign workflow.
