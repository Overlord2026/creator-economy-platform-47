# MOGL Profile

MOGL operates as a marketplace focused on athlete discovery and campaign management for brands and athletes, offering agency-like support and growing partnerships with major brands including a 2025 partnership with Dentsu. While they provide strong marketplace functionality, they place less emphasis on compliance receipts and documentation, creating an opportunity for compliance-first platforms to differentiate on trust and audit trail capabilities.
