# Icon Source Profile

Icon Source operates as a marketplace connecting brands and athletes, emphasizing deals with prepayment, contract handling, and 1099 processing with a focus on timely payments. They're positioned as "INFLCR compliance exchange ready" but primarily serve brand-athlete relationships without strong university/collective operations capabilities, leaving room for platforms that can bridge both institutional and individual creator needs.
