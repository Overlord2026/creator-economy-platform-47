# Spry Profile

Spry focuses on compliance platform services for universities, offering NIL disclosures, education, and operations with conference/school rollouts planned for 2024-2025. They're expanding into general compliance through SpryConnect, but have limited marketplace/deal origination capabilities, presenting an opportunity for platforms that can combine robust compliance with deal flow generation and marketplace functionality.
