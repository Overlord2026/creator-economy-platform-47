# OneTeam Partners Profile

OneTeam Partners specializes in group licensing for schools and athletes, managing video games, jerseys, and trading cards including serving as EA College Football's licensing agent with payments reportedly rising to ~$1,500/player for the 2026 title. They operate at significant scale in coordinated group licensing but have limited day-to-day campaign management capabilities, leaving opportunity for platforms that can bridge group licensing coordination with individual campaign management.
