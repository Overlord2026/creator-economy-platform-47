# OpenSponsorship Profile

OpenSponsorship operates as a generalist sports marketplace including NIL, serving brands with access to 15k+ athletes across NIL campaigns with multi-sport reach and self-serve pricing capabilities. As a generalist marketplace, school compliance is not native to their platform, creating opportunity for specialized NIL platforms that can offer deeper compliance integration while maintaining marketplace scale.
