# Teamworks / INFLCR Profile

Teamworks/INFLCR serves as the dominant AD/Exchange/Compliance platform for universities and collectives, offering NIL exchange, disclosure, reporting, and benchmarks powered by over $100M in 2024 football NIL payment data. They provide collectives tooling with "zero fees to athletes" in some deployments, but remain primarily AD-centric with limited brand/creator tooling, creating opportunity for a more balanced brand-creator platform approach.
