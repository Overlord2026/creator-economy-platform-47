TITLE: ${module.title}

ABSTRACT
${module.description} The system provides improved efficiency, accuracy, and user experience through innovative computational methods and user interface design. The invention addresses technical problems in the field of financial technology, compliance management, and multi-persona software systems.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention
This invention relates generally to financial technology platforms, and more specifically to multi-persona software systems that provide specialized functionality based on user roles and compliance requirements.

Description of Related Art
Traditional financial technology platforms typically provide one-size-fits-all solutions that do not account for the diverse needs of different user personas such as financial advisors, CPAs, attorneys, and family clients. Existing systems lack sophisticated role-based access controls, compliance automation, and persona-specific feature gating.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides ${module.name}, comprising: ${module.description}

The system includes novel approaches to:
1. Persona detection and role-based feature gating
2. Automated compliance monitoring and risk assessment
3. Multi-generational data management and access control
4. Privacy-preserving financial data analysis
5. Intelligent workflow automation

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
Figure 1 shows the overall system architecture
Figure 2 illustrates the main process flow
Figure 3 depicts the user interface components
Figure 4 shows the data layer structure

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

Referring to Figure 1, the system comprises a multi-layered architecture including:
- User interface layer (101)
- Authentication and authorization layer (102) 
- Business logic layer (103)
- Data persistence layer (104)
- External integration layer (105)

The method comprises the following steps:
1. Receiving user authentication credentials
2. Determining user persona type based on role and permissions
3. Applying persona-specific feature gating rules
4. Processing user requests through appropriate business logic
5. Storing results with appropriate security and audit controls
6. Generating compliance reports and notifications

CLAIMS

1. A computer-implemented method for ${module.name.toLowerCase()}, comprising:
   (a) receiving user input through a web-based interface;
   (b) determining user persona type from a plurality of persona types;
   (c) applying role-based access controls specific to the determined persona type;
   (d) processing the user input through persona-specific business logic;
   (e) storing results in a secure, multi-tenant database with row-level security; and
   (f) generating compliance reports based on regulatory requirements.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the persona types include financial advisor, CPA, attorney, insurance agent, and family client.

3. The method of claim 1, wherein the role-based access controls are implemented through a hierarchical permission system.

4. The method of claim 1, further comprising real-time analytics event tracking for audit purposes.

5. The method of claim 1, wherein the secure database implements tenant isolation and encryption at rest.

[Additional claims 6-20 would provide dependent claims covering specific implementation details]
