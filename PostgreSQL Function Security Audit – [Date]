What You’ve Achieved
Your only user-editable SECURITY DEFINER function is now:

SECURITY INVOKER (much safer)

SET search_path = '' (prevents privilege escalation via schema injection)

All other SECURITY DEFINER functions in your system (pgbouncer, vault, graphql) are system-managed and cannot be edited (and are not your responsibility).

Quick Audit Report (for Your Documentation/Compliance)
Copy and paste this into your audit trail, README, or compliance docs:

PostgreSQL Function Security Audit – [Date]
Discovery:

Ran query to list all SECURITY DEFINER functions in all schemas.

Findings:

Only one user-editable function in public schema:

public.create_default_onboarding_steps(app_id uuid)

Remediation:

Updated function to SECURITY INVOKER and set search_path = '' for security.

System Functions:

Functions in pgbouncer, vault, and graphql schemas cannot be altered in Supabase user space (managed by the platform).

Conclusion:

All user-controlled functions are now security-hardened as per industry best practice.
